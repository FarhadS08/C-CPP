//1
A) When we comment out "using namespace std;" our program cannot use cin, cout or string.
It's because they are a part of C++ standart library and without its implemantation they do not work.
If we want to remove "using namespace std;" then we have to use cin, cout and string functions as this:

std::cout, std::cin or std::string


B) If we remove Critter:: prefix from one of the methods, that method won't work because it's not going to know
which class it belonges to.




//2
a) Because we used function from std(cout, cin, string) we have to either use "using namespace std" or "std::"
for example:

std:: string

OR

using namespace std

string


B) when we comment out Critter:: compiler can not understand which function we want to take.
function we want to take is in a class called Critter, so we have to assign it the way it is writter(Critter::)
